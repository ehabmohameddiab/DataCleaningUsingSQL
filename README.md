# DataCleaningUsingSQL
a data cleaning project using SQL
In this file nash ville housing Excel file I have used SQL in Microsoft SQL DBMS tool to clean data quickly using its functions
I) Updating formats of some columns to be ready for analysis
II) Dealing with null values in Property Address Column
    seeing that it is not missing data because it is inserted in other records but missed in some so it is caught from them
III) To be used in analysis correctly and comfortably and meassures on its columns speacially I have splitted the columns of property address column into two columns 
     carrying city and address separately and it is the same mechanism done with owner address column
IV) Finding -sold as vacant- column has some dirty values like y and n that should be yes and no y is set to yes and n is set to no
V) Finding some dublicates that are the same in every column but for unique id column a query is made to remove them
VI) Final thing the unused columns that are used to create the more usable ones should be deleted


I hope this project can be useful for you even if in one small information
